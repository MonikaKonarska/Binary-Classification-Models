# **Credit scoring - Lending Club Loan Data**

Project Status: 

- [x] Active
- [ ] On-Hold
- [ ] Completed


## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is use posibilities of machine learning, statistics to modelling in R credit default data. In this repository you can find also some solutions about data cleaning, data enginerring or some methods how present data at charts using R programming.

To solve the classification problem (customer is bad or good) I used some algorithms:

- Logistic Regression,

- Decision Trees,

- Bagging with Random Forests,

- Boosting with AdaBoost.


### Data science workflow :pencil: :book:

- data wrangling/transformation,
- exploratory data analysis, 
- data preparation for modeling,
- variable selection,
- training classification models to predict bad loans,
- benchmarking machine learning prediction models.



### Technologies :computer:

- R
- RMarkdown

### Conclusions




### How to start ?

You can start with the `main.R` script.
Dataset used from **Kaggle Lending Club**. To import dataset it is needed to download a file <em>loan.csv</em> from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). 

This file contains loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015. The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables. To import data you can use script `0a.importData.R`
